- Dependency injection met services
- Backendcommunicatie
- Reactive programming

### Services
- The _injector_ is the main mechanism. Angular creates an application-wide injector for you during the bootstrap process, and additional injectors as needed. You don't have to create injectors.
    
- An injector creates dependencies and maintains a _container_ of dependency instances that it reuses, if possible.
    
- A _provider_ is an object that tells an injector how to obtain or create a dependency
