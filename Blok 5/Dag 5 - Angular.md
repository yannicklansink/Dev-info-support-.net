### Agenda
- Formulieren met validatie
- Componenten maken en testen


### ReactiveForms Module
In reactive forms, the form's structure and logic is mostly handled in the component class, rather than the template. This gives you more control over the form behavior and allows you to handle more complex validation and interaction scenarios.

### App Routing Module .ts
Angular provides the `[Router](https://angular.io/api/router/Router)` service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.

### Directives
A directive is a class that can add behavior to an element in your Angular templates. It's one of the key building blocks in Angular and enables you to create custom HTML-like elements or custom attributes for existing elements.

3 types of directives:
- Component Directive
- Attribute Directive
	- 
- Structural Directive
	- Changed DOM layout
	```html
	*ngFor
