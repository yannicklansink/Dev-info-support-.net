By contrast, server-side website programming mostly involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests.

A dynamic website might look like:

Example popular server-side languages to write code:
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- C#
- JavaScript(NodeJS)

The server-side code has full access to the server operating system and the developer can choose what programming language they want to use. Server-side and client side run in different operating system environments.

You almost always use frameworks (frameworks are collections of functions, objects, rules and more) to write server-side code.

server-side code is runÂ on a web server and that its main role is to control _what_ information is sent to the user (while client-side code mainly handles the structure and presentation of that data to the user).

A web application's job is to receive HTTP request and return HTTP responses. While interacting with a database to get or update information are very common tasks.

Single-page apps have a single HTML file that is dynamically updated when needed. It doesn't need to reload the page during it use and works within the browser.
