**Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS): It lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters.

### Cloud Service
Azure Cloud Services was designed to help developers build highly available, scalable web applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. Here's a breakdown of its main components and the role of the configuration files:

1. **Web Role and Worker Role**: These are the two primary roles within Azure Cloud Services.
    - **Web Role**: Essentially a web application running on IIS. It's designed to accept HTTP/S requests.
    - **Worker Role**: A background processing application, similar to a Windows Service, which doesn't use IIS.
2. **Service Configuration and Service Definition**:
    - **ServiceConfiguration.cscfg**: This file contains settings for the cloud service and individual roles. These settings can be changed without redeploying your application, and they can be different for each environment (e.g., production, staging).
    - **ServiceDefinition.csdef**: This file defines the service model, including the number of roles, endpoints, local storage, and other configuration settings. Changes to this file generally require redeployment of the service.
3. **Scalability**: One of the primary benefits of Azure Cloud Services is automatic scalability. You can define how many instances of each role you want, and Azure handles the deployment, load balancing, and failover for you.
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Azure Cloud Services has a lifecycle management feature that allows you to deploy applications in a staging environment, test them, and then swap them into production with minimal downtime.
5. **Updates and Fault Domain**: Azure automatically updates the underlying OS, and using fault domains, ensures that not all instances are updated at once, reducing downtime.
6. **Endpoints**: You can define various types of endpoints (internal, input, instance) to control the network traffic to and from roles.

Note: While Azure Cloud Services was a popular choice in the early days of Azure, many of its features and capabilities have been surpassed by newer Azure services like Azure App Service and Azure Kubernetes Service. However, many organizations still use Cloud Services for legacy applications or specific use cases. If you're starting a new project, it's worth considering the newer offerings unless you have a specific need for Classic Cloud Services. 

**Azure Compute Emulator**: is a local environment that simulates the Azure Cloud Services runtime environment on your development machine

For using the queue:
CloudStorageAccount().parse("");

**Azure WebJobs**: is a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to run background tasks as part of an App Service. These background tasks can be in the form of scripts or code, and they run and scale automatically within the context of an Azure App Service.
- Azure WebJobs SDK: provides a framework to simplify the process of writing WebJobs, especially for tasks like processing Azure Storage queues, blobs, and tables.

**Azure App Service**: For hosting web apps, RESTful APIs, and mobile app backends.

CDN: Content Delivery Network: Strategisch bepaalde plaatsten van servers om websites snel te leveren.

Service side functions: Bedoelt voor short-lived stateless functions. Ideaal voor het uitvoeren berekeningen server side. Op basis van triggers (er zijn veel triggers). Mooi te gebruiken als integratie moment. Lijkt op IFTTT (zappier).
