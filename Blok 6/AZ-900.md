Cloud computing services:
- Storage
- Compute power
- Networking
- Analytics
- and more...

Scalability: The ability to scale. So allocate and deallocate resources at any time
Elasticity: The ability to scale dynamically. 
Agility: The ability to react fast (scale quickly)
Fault tolerance: the design principles to recover from natural or human disasters. 
High availability: The agreed level of operational uptime for the system. 

Economies of scale: The cost per unit (service) lowers as the size of the requests grows.

CapEx: Own infrastructure. Big initial investment. 
OpEx: Rent infrastructure. No initial investment.

Consumption based model:
- no upfront costs
- no wasted resources

Cloud provider can provide:
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	- Storage (ssd), networking (routers switches, internet), servers (memory, motherboard, cpu), virtualization (VM)
	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- OS (windows, linux), middleware (software), runtime (docker, iis)
	Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- Application Data (data, apps)

Public cloud: Everything runs on cloud providers hardware. Some services share hardware with other customers.
Private cloud: Everything runs on your own datacenter. You maintain the hardware. 
Hybrid cloud: Combines public and private. 

Data center: 
 - Physical facility
 - Hosting for group of networked servers
Region:
- Geographical area
- Usually more datacenters
Availability Zone:
- Regional feature
- Designed to protect from data center failures
Region Pair:
- Each region is paired with another region
- Physical isolation with at least 300 miles distance

Azure resources:
- Object used to manage services in Azure
- Represents service lifecycle
- Saved as JSON definition
- Each resource must be in one, and only one resource group
Resource Groups:
- Grouping resources
Resource manager:
- Management layer for all resources and resource groups
